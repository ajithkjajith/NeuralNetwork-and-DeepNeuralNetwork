# NeuralNetwork-and-DeepNeuralNetwork
Building Deep Neural Network for image classification

This project is part of "Neural Network and Deep Learning" course under Coursera by deeplearning.io 
1. Logistic Regression file will classify the images based on logisticRegressionClassifier
2. OneHidden Layer file will classigy the images based on classification with one hidden layer.
3. Building Deep Neural Network and deep neural network application file allows us to create deep neural network for image classification.
